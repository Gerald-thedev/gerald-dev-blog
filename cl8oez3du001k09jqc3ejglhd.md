## The Importance of Wireframing in Design

You would agree that all humans have a skeletal system. It is the skeleton that structures the human body. The same principles apply to wireframing, every design will need some sort of structure on where elements will be placed before implementation in the final design. In this article, I will be discussing the importance of wireframing in design.

## What is a Wireframe?
A wireframe is a blueprint that helps designers to come up with a structure for an actual design. 

It is more like a rough sketch of what the final design will look like. You don't have to be Picasso to draw wireframes for your designs. The most important thing is that you convey the message and the aim of that design is achieved. Even a five-year-old can sketch wireframes, as long as the idea of the design is understood. Besides, wireframes are not supposed to be aesthetically pleasing.

## Stages of Wireframes

- Low Fidelity

- High Fidelity

The word **Fidelity** is simply the accuracy of what the final version of the design will look like after implementation. 

### Low Fidelity
This is the first stage of wireframing and does not represent the final outlook of the design. It is usually the first sketch without any accurate dimensions, color, or fonts. This stage is usually in black and white or more like a rough sketch and isn't meant to be attractive.

This stage is where decisions are made pertaining to the entire design, whereby everyone involved in the project agrees on the structure. It is easier to implement changes and is less cost-effective.

### High Fidelity
This is the final stage of the design where the typography, color, layouts, and dimensions are implemented. It is considered the final output of the design, though changes could still be made at this stage due to the preferences of the stakeholders. 

Although, this stage of the wireframe is to get a feel of what the real project will look like. You can almost be certain that this is what the final product will look like. This is the stage in which the design will be handed over to the developer team to bring the design to life after its approval.

You might be wondering why we even need to sketch wireframes in the first place. Wireframes will provide a baseline for your actual design. 

It is advised to make your sketches on a piece of paper before even making use of a design tool. This is because it is much more efficient to make a rough sketch on a piece of paper when you feel inspired at any point in time, compared to trying to open Figma or Sketch on a desktop.

Using pen and paper for your rough sketch wireframes is less cost-effective, easily accessible, and easily disposable when mistakes are made.

## The importance of wireframes
There is nothing as destructive as jumping into creating designs without making plans on what the designs should look like or what you hope to achieve with that design. It is necessary to communicate with everyone involved with the end product during the design stage.

Imagine working with a team of developers as a designer, without any wireframes. You hand in the designs, and your designs have been implemented by the development team, you then realize that you omitted certain features that were discussed with the stakeholders. 

Well, someone is in trouble. You could have easily saved yourself and the development team some time, energy, and money by simply implementing wireframes during the design process. 

Wireframes accommodate indecisiveness, save time, and give the entire project direction on how to go about the look and feel of the end product. 

## Conclusion
It is much easier to make amends during the stages of wireframes than to make changes during the development stage. "Whoever fails to plan, plans to fail." Always try to enjoy the process. "Anything worth doing is worth doing well." Hopefully, you get to implement more wireframes in subsequent designs and now understand their importance.
